# HEYO Mobile Application

Heyo is a mobile application built with React Native. It is a social media app that sends push alerts to friends and family 
overseas to send them positive messages and let them know you are thinking about them without the effort of a response involved.

I am still developing this application as to implement the push notifications I need an apple developers license so I am 
working on that now and I also want to add in geo location so that my background aesthetic is updated in real time depending 
on the individual contacts location.

I used:

React Native

Twitter Digits

React Alerts

React Address Phonebook

Once I have finished this application I am going to put it on the app store so it will be available for free
